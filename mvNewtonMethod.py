#    Numerical Methods ISV Model Using Newton-Raphson Method
# --------------------------------------------------------------

# Description: 
# This model utilizes a set of material constants (C_n through C_m)
# along with inputs of strain rate and time step to calculate and predict
# an accurate stress-strain curve for that given material. This is a 
# viscoplastic model (strain-rate sensitive) that uses a Radial-Return
# scheme to predict deformation elastically, and then correct for any plastic
# deformation that also occurs. Plastic deformation behavior is governed by
# the Flow Rule and Isotropic Hardening. These equations may be solved either
# analytically or numerically (using the Newton-Raphson (N-R) method). The analytical
# method will be solved first, requiring a much smaller time step for 
# accuracy, while the N-R method is solved second which retains accuracy at 
# much greater time steps. The two methods are then compared and tested to 
# optimize time step, computational time, and accuracy of the resulting curve.
